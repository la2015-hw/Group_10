# Galaxy Morphology & Quenching State Prediction  

## Research Question  
**Galaxy Morphology Classification and Quenching State Prediction using ML models**  

This project investigates the effectiveness of different data modalities â€” **tabular data** (catalog features), **image data** (galaxy images), and their **combination** â€” in predicting galaxy morphology and quenching states.  
By comparing models trained on individual vs. combined modalities, we aim to understand whether integration improves classification performance.
